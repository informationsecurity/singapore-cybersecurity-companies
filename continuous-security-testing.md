# Continuous Security Testing in Singapore in 2025: the best providers to test real-time resilience

In 2025, cyber threats evolve at such a pace that periodic security tests are insufficient. Companies that truly want to be resilient must move from a "snapshot" approach to a **continuous** model, capable of detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities the moment they appear.

**Continuous Security Testing (CST)** represents this new paradigm: a mix of penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, behavioral analysis and attack simulations conducted **continuously**, integrated into DevOps and SOC processes.

This guide presents the **10 best Continuous Security Testing providers in Singapore in 2025**, with focus on methodology, integration, verticalization and response capabilities.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is Continuous Security Testing?

It is a process of constant verification of the security of systems, applications and infrastructures, which simulates real attacks and detects vulnerabilities in real time.

### How is it different from a classic Penetration Test?

Pen Test is "one-time", while CST is continuous. CST integrates into business processes to identify new vulnerabilities at the time of release or configuration change.

### Who needs CST?

Companies with frequent release cycles (DevOps), regulated organizations, enterprises exposed to high risks (public sector, telco, banking, cloud).

### How much does CST cost in Singapore in 2025?

It depends on the level of automation, customization and manual validation. Solutions start from S$1,500/month up to S$15,000/month for enterprise environments.

### Does ISGroup also provide assisted remediation?

Yes. In addition to continuous testing, ISGroup supports technical teams with fix sessions, post-remediation testing and personalized consulting.

### What advantages does it bring compared to vulnerability scanning?

CST offers manual validation, real exploit simulations and qualified alerts, reducing noise and increasing data relevance.

### Is CST required by regulations?

It is recommended by standards like ISO/IEC 27001, NIS2, DORA and local guidelines for critical systems, although it is not yet formally mandatory.

### Can it be integrated into the DevOps cycle?

Yes. CST is part of DevSecOps: it can be activated at every commit, build or release, generating alerts only in case of real problems.
