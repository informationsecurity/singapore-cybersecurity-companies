# Secure Architecture Review in Singapore in 2025: the best providers for secure cloud, hybrid and legacy architecture review

In 2025, the growing complexity of IT environments, the push to the cloud, regulations (NIS2, DORA, ISO/IEC 27001) and exposure to advanced threats make it essential to perform a **Secure Architecture Review (SAR)**. This activity analyzes IT, OT and cloud architectures to identify:

- Design vulnerabilities
- Insecure configurations
- Supply chain risks
- Segregation and zero trust gaps
- Security control, IAM, logging, encryption deficiencies

In this guide you'll find the **10 best Singapore providers for Secure Architecture Review in 2025**, with focus on attacker-centric approach, zero trust frameworks, multi-cloud environments and regulatory compliance.
